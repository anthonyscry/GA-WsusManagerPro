## Getting Started

### Launching the Application

1. Right-click `WsusManager.exe`
2. Select **Run as administrator**

> **Important**: Administrator privileges are required for all WSUS operations.

### First Launch

On first launch, the application will:
1. Detect your WSUS installation
2. Load default settings
3. Display the dashboard

If WSUS is not installed, you'll see warnings on the dashboard. Use **Install WSUS** to set up a new server.

---

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is your main monitoring view, showing the health of your WSUS infrastructure at a glance.

### Status Cards

The dashboard displays four color-coded status cards:

#### Services Card
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | All services running (SQL, WSUS, IIS) |
| Orange | Some services running |
| Red | Critical services stopped |

#### Database Card
| Color | Size Range | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Green | < 7 GB | Healthy |
| Yellow | 7-9 GB | Consider cleanup |
| Red | > 9 GB | Cleanup required (approaching 10GB limit) |

#### Disk Space Card
| Color | Free Space | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Green | > 50 GB | Healthy |
| Yellow | 10-50 GB | Monitor |
| Red | < 10 GB | Free space immediately |

#### Automation Card
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | Scheduled task configured and ready |
| Orange | No scheduled task configured |

### Auto-Refresh

The dashboard automatically refreshes every **30 seconds**. A refresh guard prevents overlapping operations that could hang the UI.

---

## Server Mode Toggle

WSUS Manager supports two server modes to show only relevant operations:

### Online Mode
For WSUS servers connected to the internet:
- **Visible**: Export to Media, Online Sync (sync with Microsoft Update)
- **Hidden**: Import from Media

### Air-Gap Mode
For WSUS servers on disconnected networks:
- **Visible**: Import from Media
- **Hidden**: Export to Media, Online Sync

### Changing Modes

Server Mode is auto-detected based on internet connectivity.

1. Ensure the server has internet access for Online mode
2. Disconnect to switch to Air-Gap mode
3. Menu items update automatically

### Online Sync

Runs comprehensive sync and maintenance tasks.

> **Online-only:** Run Online Sync on the **Online** WSUS server.

**Sync Profiles:**
| Profile | Operations | Use When |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Full Sync** | Sync → Cleanup → Ultimate Cleanup → Backup → Export | Monthly maintenance |
| **Quick Sync** | Sync → Cleanup → Backup (skip heavy cleanup) | Weekly quick sync |
| **Sync Only** | Synchronize and approve updates only | Just need updates |

**What Full Sync does:**
1. Synchronizes with Microsoft Update
2. Declines superseded, expired, and old updates
3. Approves new updates (Critical, Security, Rollups, Service Packs, Updates, Definition Updates)
4. Runs WSUS cleanup wizard
5. Cleans database records and purges declined updates
6. Optimizes indexes
7. Backs up database
8. Exports to configured paths (optional)

**Export Options (Optional):**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Full Export Path** | Network share for complete backup + content mirror |
| **Differential Export Path** | Destination for recent changes only (e.g., USB drive for air-gap) |
| **Export Days** | Age filter for differential export (default: 30 days) |

> **Note:** Export fields are optional. If not specified, the export step is skipped.

**When to run:**
- Monthly (Full Sync recommended)
- Weekly (Quick Sync)
- After initial sync
- When database grows large

**UX Note:** Some phases can be quiet for several minutes; the GUI refreshes status roughly every 30 seconds.

### Schedule Online Sync Task

Creates or updates the scheduled task that runs Online Sync.

> **Online-only:** Create the schedule on the **Online** WSUS server.

**Steps:**
1. Click **Schedule Task** in the Online Sync section
2. Choose schedule (Weekly/Monthly/Daily)
3. Set the start time (default: Saturday at 02:00)
4. Select the sync profile (Full, Quick, or SyncOnly)
5. Enter credentials for unattended execution
6. Click **Create Task**

**Default Recommendation:** Weekly Full Sync on Saturday at 02:00.

### Deep Cleanup

Aggressive cleanup for space recovery.

**What it does:**
1. Removes obsolete updates
2. Cleans superseded updates
3. Removes unneeded content files
4. Shrinks database
5. Compacts content directory

**When to use:**
- Database approaching 10GB limit
- Disk space critically low
- After declining many updates

### Health Check

Verifies WSUS configuration without making changes.

**Checks performed:**
- Service status (SQL, WSUS, IIS)
- Database connectivity
- Firewall rules
- Directory permissions
- SSL/HTTPS configuration

### Health + Repair

Runs health check and automatically fixes issues.

**What it fixes:**
- Starts stopped services
- Creates missing firewall rules
- Sets directory permissions
- Repairs service dependencies

### Reset Content

Forces WSUS to re-verify all content files against the database.

> **Air-Gap Tip:** Use this after importing a database backup when WSUS shows "content is still downloading" even though files exist.

**What it does:**
1. Stops WSUS service
2. Runs `wsusutil reset`
3. Restarts WSUS service

**When to use:**
- After database restore/import on air-gapped servers
- When WSUS shows download status but content files are present
- To fix content verification mismatches

**Note:** This operation can take several minutes depending on content size, as WSUS re-verifies each file.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance

- Monitor database size (aim for < 7 GB)
- Keep at least 50 GB free disk space

### Before Major Operations
- Create a database backup
- Check disk space availability
- Verify all services are running

### After Sync
- Review new updates
- Decline unneeded updates
- Run cleanup if needed

### Air-Gap Transfers
- Use USB 3.0 drives for speed
- Verify exports before transport
- Test imports on non-production first
