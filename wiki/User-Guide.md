On first launch, the application will:
1. Detect your WSUS installation
2. Load default settings
3. Display the dashboard

If WSUS is not installed, you'll see warnings on the dashboard. Use **Install WSUS** to set up a new server.

---

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is your main monitoring view, showing the health of your WSUS infrastructure at a glance.

### Status Cards

The dashboard displays four color-coded status cards:

#### Services Card
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | All services running (SQL, WSUS, IIS) |
| Orange | Some services running |
| Red | Critical services stopped |

#### Database Card
| Color | Size Range | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Green | < 7 GB | Healthy |
| Yellow | 7-9 GB | Consider cleanup |
| Red | > 9 GB | Cleanup required (approaching 10GB limit) |

#### Disk Space Card
| Color | Free Space | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Green | > 50 GB | Healthy |
| Yellow | 10-50 GB | Monitor |
| Red | < 10 GB | Free space immediately |

#### Automation Card
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | Scheduled task configured and ready |
| Orange | No scheduled task configured |

### Auto-Refresh

The dashboard automatically refreshes every **30 seconds**. A refresh guard prevents overlapping operations that could hang the UI.

---

## Server Mode Toggle

WSUS Manager supports two server modes to show only relevant operations:

### Online Mode
For WSUS servers connected to the internet:
- **Visible**: Export to Media, Online Sync (sync with Microsoft Update)
- **Hidden**: Import from Media

### Air-Gap Mode
For WSUS servers on disconnected networks:
- **Visible**: Import from Media
- **Hidden**: Export to Media, Online Sync

### Changing Modes

Server Mode is auto-detected based on internet connectivity.

1. Ensure the server has internet access for Online mode
2. Disconnect to switch to Air-Gap mode
3. Menu items update automatically

---

## Operations Menu

### Install WSUS

Installs WSUS with SQL Server Express from scratch.

**Steps:**
1. Click **Install WSUS**
2. Browse to folder containing SQL installers
3. Click **Install**
4. Wait 15-30 minutes for completion

> **Note:** If the default installer folder is missing SQL/SSMS files, the installer will prompt you to select the correct folder.

**Prerequisites:**
- SQL installers in selected folder
- No existing WSUS installation
- Administrator privileges

### Create GPO

Copies Group Policy Objects to `C:\WSUS\WSUS GPO` for transfer to a Domain Controller.

**Steps:**
1. Click **Create GPO**
2. Enter WSUS hostname, HTTP port, and HTTPS port
3. If either port is blank or invalid, WSUS Manager uses defaults (`8530` for HTTP, `8531` for HTTPS)
4. Copy `C:\WSUS\WSUS GPO` (including generated `Run-WsusGpoSetup.ps1`) to the Domain Controller
5. On the DC, run as Administrator:
   ```powershell
   cd 'C:\WSUS\WSUS GPO'
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Run-WsusGpoSetup.ps1
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Run-WsusGpoSetup.ps1 -UseHttps
   ```

**Important:** Run the wrapper script locally on the Domain Controller. It applies GPOs directly on the DC and does not prompt for WSUS-server credentials or use remote execution mode.

**To force clients to update:**
```powershell
# On individual clients:
gpupdate /force

# From DC (all domain computers):
Get-ADComputer -Filter * | ForEach-Object { Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer $_.Name -Force }

# Verify on clients:
gpresult /r | findstr WSUS
```

**GPOs Created:**
| GPO Name | Purpose | Link Target |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| WSUS Update Policy | Client update settings | Domain root |
| WSUS Inbound Allow | Firewall rules for WSUS server | Member Servers\WSUS Server |
| WSUS Outbound Allow | Firewall rules for clients | Workstations, Member Servers, DCs |

### Restore Database

Restores SUSDB from a backup file.

**Steps:**
1. Click **Restore Database**
2. Confirm the warning dialog
3. Ensure backup file is at `C:\WSUS\`
4. Wait for restore to complete

**Prerequisites:**
- Valid `.bak` file at `C:\WSUS\`
- Update files in `C:\WSUS\WsusContent\`
- SQL Server running

### Export to Media

Exports database and update files for transfer to air-gapped servers.

**Steps:**
1. Click **Export to Media**
2. Choose export type:
   - **Full Export**: Complete database and all files
   - **Differential Export**: Only recent updates (N days)
3. Select destination folder (USB drive)
4. Wait for export to complete

**Output:**
```
[Destination]\
├── SUSDB_backup_[date].bak     # Database backup
├── WsusContent\                 # Update files
└── export_manifest.json         # Export metadata
```

### Import from Media

Imports updates from USB media to an air-gapped server.

**Steps:**
1. Click **Import from Media**
2. In the Transfer dialog:
   - Select **Import** direction
   - Browse to **Source (External Media)** folder on USB drive
   - Browse to **Destination (WSUS Server)** folder (default: `C:\WSUS`)
3. Click **Start Transfer**
4. Wait for import to complete

> **Note:** The import runs fully non-interactive using the selected folders and will not prompt for additional input during the copy operation.

**Dialog Options:**
| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Source (External Media) | USB drive or network path containing export | (Browse required) |
| Destination (WSUS Server) | Local WSUS content directory | `C:\WSUS` |

**Prerequisites:**
- Valid export folder structure on source media
- Sufficient disk space on destination
- WSUS services running

### Online Sync

Runs comprehensive sync and maintenance tasks.

> **Online-only:** Run Online Sync on the **Online** WSUS server.

**Sync Profiles:**
| Profile | Operations | Use When |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Full Sync** | Sync → Cleanup → Ultimate Cleanup → Backup → Export | Monthly maintenance |
| **Quick Sync** | Sync → Cleanup → Backup (skip heavy cleanup) | Weekly quick sync |
| **Sync Only** | Synchronize and approve updates only | Just need updates |

**What Full Sync does:**
1. Synchronizes with Microsoft Update
2. Declines superseded, expired, and old updates
3. Approves new updates (Critical, Security, Rollups, Service Packs, Updates, Definition Updates)
4. Runs WSUS cleanup wizard
5. Cleans database records and purges declined updates
6. Optimizes indexes
7. Backs up database
8. Exports to configured paths (optional)

**Export Options (Optional):**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Full Export Path** | Network share for complete backup + content mirror |
| **Differential Export Path** | Destination for recent changes only (e.g., USB drive for air-gap) |
| **Export Days** | Age filter for differential export (default: 30 days) |

> **Note:** Export fields are optional. If not specified, the export step is skipped.

**When to run:**
- Monthly (Full Sync recommended)
- Weekly (Quick Sync)
- After initial sync
- When database grows large

**UX Note:** Some phases can be quiet for several minutes; the GUI refreshes status roughly every 30 seconds.

### Schedule Online Sync Task

Creates or updates the scheduled task that runs Online Sync.

> **Online-only:** Create the schedule on the **Online** WSUS server.

**Steps:**
1. Click **Schedule Task** in the Online Sync section
2. Choose schedule (Weekly/Monthly/Daily)
3. Set the start time (default: Saturday at 02:00)
4. Select the sync profile (Full, Quick, or SyncOnly)
5. Enter credentials for unattended execution
6. Click **Create Task**

**Default Recommendation:** Weekly Full Sync on Saturday at 02:00.

### Deep Cleanup

Comprehensive database cleanup for space recovery and performance optimization.

**What it does (6 steps):**
1. **WSUS built-in cleanup** - Declines superseded updates, removes obsolete updates, cleans unneeded content files
2. **Remove declined supersession records** - Cleans `tbRevisionSupersedesUpdate` table for declined updates
3. **Remove superseded supersession records** - Batched cleanup (10,000 records per batch) for superseded updates
4. **Delete declined updates** - Purges declined updates from database via `spDeleteUpdate` (100-record batches)
5. **Index optimization** - Rebuilds highly fragmented indexes (>30%), reorganizes moderately fragmented (10-30%), updates statistics
6. **Database shrink** - Compacts database to reclaim disk space (with retry logic for backup contention)

**Progress reporting:**
- Shows step number and description for each phase
- Reports batch progress during large operations
- Displays database size before and after shrink
- Shows total duration at completion

**When to use:**
- Database approaching 10GB limit (SQL Express)
- Disk space critically low
- After declining many updates manually
- Quarterly maintenance

**Duration:** 30-90 minutes depending on database size

### Diagnostics

Comprehensive health check with automatic repair (combines former Health Check and Health + Repair).

**What it checks and fixes:**
- **Services**: SQL Server, WSUS, IIS - starts stopped services, sets correct startup type
- **SQL Browser**: Starts and sets to Automatic if not running
- **Database connectivity**: Verifies connection to SUSDB
- **SQL Login**: Creates NETWORK SERVICE login with dbcreator role if missing
- **Firewall rules**: Creates inbound rules for ports 8530/8531 if missing
- **Directory permissions**: Sets correct ACLs on WSUS content folder
- **Application Pool**: Starts WsusPool if stopped
- **GPO deployment artifacts baseline**: Verifies `C:\WSUS\WSUS GPO` contains required deployment files; can create missing local `WSUS GPOs` folder
- **GPO wrapper baseline**: Verifies `Run-WsusGpoSetup.ps1` contains required baseline tokens (`-UseHttps`, `Set-WsusGroupPolicy`)

**Safe auto-fix boundary:**
- Diagnostics only performs local-safe remediations on the WSUS server (services, firewall rules, ACLs, app pool, local folder creation).
- Diagnostics does not rewrite domain GPO links, bulk-edit client WSUS policy, or push remote registry/domain-wide policy changes.

**Output:**
- Clear pass/fail status for each check
- Automatic fix applied when issues detected
- Summary of all findings at completion

### Client Tools

Tools for validating and remediating WSUS client-side configuration.

#### Fleet WSUS Target Audit

Audits WSUS target settings across all client hostnames currently in dashboard inventory.

**Expected target inputs:**
- **Hostname**: Expected WSUS server hostname used by clients (required)
- **HTTP port**: Expected WSUS HTTP port (`1-65535`); leave blank to use default `8530`
- **HTTPS port**: Expected WSUS HTTPS status port (`1-65535`); leave blank to use default `8531`

**Result statuses:**
- **Compliant**: `UseWUServer=1` and client WSUS/status URLs match expected hostname and ports
- **Mismatch**: Client WSUS policy is enabled but URL/port values differ, or `UseWUServer` is not enabled
- **Unreachable**: Host could not be contacted over WinRM
- **Error**: Audit failed for that host due to execution/parsing/runtime error

**Grouped target summary:**
- Operation output includes an **Observed WSUS targets** grouping (target tuple -> host count).
- Use it to quickly identify drift clusters (for example, many clients pointing to an old hostname/port set) before deciding on GPO or remediation actions.

### Reset Content

Forces WSUS to re-verify all content files against the database.

> **Air-Gap Tip:** Use this after importing a database backup when WSUS shows "content is still downloading" even though files exist.

**What it does:**
1. Stops WSUS service
2. Runs `wsusutil reset`
3. Restarts WSUS service

**When to use:**
- After database restore/import on air-gapped servers
- When WSUS shows download status but content files are present
- To fix content verification mismatches

**Note:** This operation can take several minutes depending on content size, as WSUS re-verifies each file.
