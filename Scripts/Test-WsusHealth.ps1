Script: Test-WsusHealth.ps1
Purpose: Comprehensive WSUS health check and repair utility
Overview:
  - Checks SQL Server, WSUS, and IIS services
  - Validates firewall rules
  - Verifies content path permissions and configuration
  - Tests database connectivity
  - Provides optional auto-repair for all issues

Notes:
  - Run as Administrator on the WSUS server
  - Combines functionality of service checks and content validation
  - Uses WsusHealth module for comprehensive diagnostics
===============================================================================

.PARAMETER ContentPath
    WSUS content path to validate (default: C:\WSUS)

.PARAMETER SqlInstance
    SQL Server instance name (default: .\SQLEXPRESS)

.PARAMETER Repair
    Automatically repair all detected issues

.PARAMETER SkipDatabase
    Skip database connectivity checks (faster for service-only checks)

.EXAMPLE
    .\Test-WsusHealth.ps1
    Run health check without repairs

.EXAMPLE
    .\Test-WsusHealth.ps1 -Repair
    Run health check and automatically repair all issues

.EXAMPLE
    .\Test-WsusHealth.ps1 -ContentPath "D:\WSUS" -Repair
    Check and repair with custom content path
