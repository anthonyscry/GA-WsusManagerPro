## Usage

### GUI Application

Run `WsusManager.exe` as Administrator. The main dashboard shows:

- **Server Status:** WSUS service, SQL connection, update counts
- **Quick Actions:** Start Services, Diagnostics, Online Sync
- **Navigation:** Dashboard, Diagnostics, Database, WSUS Operations, Install, Schedule, Client Tools, Settings

**Common Workflows:**

1. **First-time Setup:** Click "Install WSUS" and follow the wizard
2. **Health Check:** Click "Diagnostics" to scan and auto-fix issues
3. **Database Cleanup:** Navigate to Database → "Deep Cleanup"
4. **Air-Gap Sync:** Navigate to WSUS Operations → "Transfer" → Export/Import
5. **Client Management:** Navigate to Client Tools → select operation

**Note:** CLI interface is planned for v4.5. Use GUI for all operations.

### Themes

Switch themes via Settings → Theme Picker:
- **DefaultDark** - Clean dark theme with blue accents
- **Slate** - Professional gray-blue theme
- **ClassicBlue** - Traditional Windows blue
- **Serenity** - Calming teal and gray
- **Rose** - Warm rose and slate
- **JustBlack** - Minimal high-contrast black

## Troubleshooting

### "WSUS service not installed"
**Cause:** WSUS role not installed on server
**Solution:** Install WSUS role via Server Manager or click "Install WSUS" button

### "Cannot connect to SQL Server"
**Cause:** SQL Server service not running
**Solution:** Run Diagnostics → auto-starts SQL service

### "Access denied" errors
**Cause:** Not running as Administrator
**Solution:** Right-click EXE → "Run as administrator"

### "Content is still downloading" after restore
**Cause:** WSUS re-verifying content files (can take 30+ minutes)
**Solution:** Wait for completion, or run "Reset Content" to force re-verification

### WinRM operations fail
**Cause:** WinRM not enabled on remote host
**Solution:** Enable WinRM: `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` on target machine

### Application won't start
**Cause:** .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 not installed
**Solution:** Download from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0

### Large file deletion hangs
**Cause:** SQL transaction log full during mass update deletion
**Solution:** Run Diagnostics to shrink log, or use "Deep Cleanup" which handles this automatically

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cd src
dotnet test --verbosity normal

# Run specific test project
dotnet test WsusManager.Tests

# Run tests with code coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Generate coverage report
reportgenerator -reports:*/coverage.cobertura.xml -targetdir:coverage-report
```

## Performance Benchmarking

The C# version includes BenchmarkDotNet performance testing for tracking critical operations.

### Running Benchmarks Locally

```bash
# Run all benchmarks (requires Windows)
dotnet run --project src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/WsusManager.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release

# Run specific benchmark category
dotnet run --project src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/WsusManager.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release --filter "*Startup*"
dotnet run --project src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/WsusManager.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release --filter "*Database*"
dotnet run --project src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/WsusManager.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release --filter "*WinRM*"
```

### Benchmark Results

Results are generated in `src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/`:
- `results.html` - Interactive HTML report with charts
- `results.csv` - Raw timing data for regression detection

### CI/CD Benchmarks

BenchmarkDotNet runs are triggered manually via GitHub Actions:
1. Navigate to **Actions** → **Build C# WSUS Manager**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select branch and click **Run workflow**
4. Download `benchmark-results` artifact when complete

### Performance Regressions

Builds fail if performance degrades >10% from baseline. Baselines are stored in `src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/baselines/`:
- `startup-baseline.csv` - Cold/warm startup times
- `database-baseline.csv` - Query and connection times
- `winrm-baseline.csv` - WinRM operation times

### Updating Baselines

If performance legitimately changes (e.g., new features), update baselines:
```bash
# Run benchmarks
dotnet run --project src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/WsusManager.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release

# Copy new results to baselines
cp src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results-*-report.csv src/WsusManager.Benchmarks/baselines/
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Run tests before committing (`dotnet test`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
6. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style

- Follow .editorconfig settings (enforced via Roslyn analyzers)
- Use XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Run `dotnet format` before committing
- Target 70% branch coverage for new code

## Important Notes

### Database Restore / Reset Time

After restoring a WSUS database or performing a reset operation, the WSUS server will need to re-verify and re-download update content. **This process can take 30+ minutes depending on the size of your update content.** During this time:

- The dashboard may show "Update is downloading" status
- This is normal behavior - do not interrupt the process
- Content verification happens automatically in the background
- Large content stores (50GB+) may take several hours to fully re-verify

### Performance Metrics

Compared to PowerShell v3.8.x:
- **5x faster startup** (200-400ms vs 1-2s)
- **2.5x faster operations** (health check: ~2s vs ~5s)
- **3x less memory** (50-80MB vs 150-200MB)
- **52% less code** (1,180 vs 2,482 LOC)
