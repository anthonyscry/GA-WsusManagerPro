# WSUS + SQL Express (2022) Automation

This repository contains a set of PowerShell scripts to deploy a **WSUS server backed by SQL Server Express 2022**, validate content paths/permissions, and run ongoing maintenance.

> **Important content path rule**
> - **Content folder must be `C:\WSUS`.**
> - If you set `CONTENT_DIR` to `C:\WSUS\wsuscontent`, WSUS will stay in a **constant download state** because the database does not register files correctly.

## Quick start (recommended flow)

1. **Copy the repo to the target server** and place installers in `C:\WSUS\SQLDB`:
   - `C:\WSUS\SQLDB\SQLEXPRADV_x64_ENU.exe` (SQL Express 2022 Advanced)
   - `C:\WSUS\SQLDB\SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe` (SSMS)

2. **Run the install script** (installs SQL + WSUS):
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Run-WsusSql.ps1
   ```

3. **Verify content path and permissions** (fixes any issues found):
   ```powershell
   .\Check-WSUSContent.ps1 -FixIssues
   ```
   > `-FixIssues` is for the validator script only. Use `-RunContentValidation -FixContentIssues` (or `-FixIssues` alias) with `Run-WsusSql.ps1` if you want validation after install.

4. **Online WSUS only:** configure products/classifications in the WSUS console, then synchronize. (Airgapped/offline WSUS imports the database and content from the online server.)

## Domain controller (GPO) setup

To push WSUS settings to clients via Group Policy, run the new GPO script on a domain controller with **RSAT Group Policy Management** installed:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Set-WsusGpo.ps1 -WsusServerUrl "http://WSUSServerName:8530"
```

Optional: import a backed up GPO (if present) and link to an OU:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Set-WsusGpo.ps1 `
  -WsusServerUrl "http://WSUSServerName:8530" `
  -BackupPath "C:\WSUS\Scripts\GpoBackups" `
  -TargetOU "OU=Workstations,DC=example,DC=local"
```

## What the scripts do (by category)
All script names below match the PowerShell files in the repo root and are grouped by their primary use.
Each entry includes **what it does**, **why you would use it**, and **where to run it** to make the list easier to scan.

---

### Install / setup

#### `Run-WsusSql.ps1` (install flow)
**What it does:** Runs the install script for WSUS + SQL Express (validation is optional).  
**Why use it:** Recommended install flow; run validation separately or opt into validation when needed.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server** you are provisioning.

```powershell
# Default: install only
.\Run-WsusSql.ps1

# Skip install (validation only)
.\Run-WsusSql.ps1 -SkipInstall -RunContentValidation

# Run content validation after install
.\Run-WsusSql.ps1 -RunContentValidation

# Run content validation and auto-fix issues
.\Run-WsusSql.ps1 -RunContentValidation -FixContentIssues
.\Run-WsusSql.ps1 -RunContentValidation -FixIssues  # Alias for FixContentIssues
```

#### `install.ps1`
**What it does:** Full **SQL Express 2022 + SSMS + WSUS** installation and configuration, including:
- SQL Express setup (silent)
- SSMS install
- SQL networking + firewall rules
- WSUS role install + post-install configuration
- IIS virtual directory fix + permissions
- Registry settings to bypass the initial WSUS wizard
**Why use it:** Automates a complete WSUS + SQL Express build without manual steps.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server** hosting WSUS + SQL Express.

#### `Set-WsusGpo.ps1`
**What it does:** Creates or imports a WSUS client GPO and applies the required Windows Update policy keys.  
**Why use it:** Centralizes WSUS client settings via Group Policy.  
**Where to run it:** On a **Domain Controller** with **RSAT Group Policy Management** installed.

---

### Import

#### `ImportScript.ps1`
**What it does:** Restores a SUSDB backup and re-attaches WSUS to it.  
**Why use it:** Rehydrates WSUS from a known-good database backup (e.g., for offline/airgapped servers).  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server** that will host the restored database.

> **Note:** the backup path is currently hard-coded. Rename or update it to the latest `.bak` file before running:
> `C:\WSUS\SUSDB_20251124.bak`

---

### Maintenance / utility

#### `WsusMaintenance.ps1`
**What it does:** Monthly maintenance automation (run on the **online** WSUS server):
- Syncs and updates the upstream WSUS server
- Monitors downloads
- Declines old superseded updates
- Runs cleanup tasks
- Backs up the database and content for later import
- Optionally runs ultimate cleanup before the backup (use `-SkipUltimateCleanup` to skip)
**Why use it:** Keeps WSUS healthy and produces backups for downstream/offline use.  
**Where to run it:** On the **online/upstream WSUS server**.

#### `Ultimate-WsusCleanup.ps1`
**What it does:** Quarterly or emergency cleanup:
- Deletes supersession records
- Removes declined updates
- Rebuilds indexes and updates stats
- Shrinks SUSDB
**Why use it:** Deep cleanup when WSUS performance/storage needs attention.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server** (typically the online/upstream instance).

#### `Reset-WsusContent.ps1`
**What it does:** Runs `wsusutil.exe reset` to force a full re-validation of all WSUS content.  
**Why use it:** Fixes or validates content issues and forces a full re-check of downloads.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server** that hosts the content store.

#### `Force-WSUSCheckIn.ps1`
**What it does:** Forces a WSUS client to check in (optionally clears Windows Update cache).  
**Why use it:** Troubleshoot client reporting or trigger immediate status updates.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS client machine**.

---

### Troubleshooting / validation

> **Note:** `Run-WsusUnified.ps1` has been removed. Use `Run-WsusTroubleshooter.ps1` for the unified health check workflow.

#### `Run-WsusTroubleshooter.ps1`
**What it does:** Runs service-level auto-fixes (SQL/WSUS/IIS) and then validates WSUS content path configuration.  
**Why use it:** One-stop health check for common WSUS service issues and content path correctness.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server**.

#### `Check-WSUSContent.ps1`
**What it does:** Validates that WSUS is correctly using **`C:\WSUS`** and can optionally fix:
- SUSDB content path
- Registry content path
- IIS virtual directory content path
- Permissions (NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE, IIS_IUSRS, WsusPool)
- File state records and download queue
**Why use it:** Diagnose and repair common WSUS content path and permission issues.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server** hosting the content store.

#### `autofix.ps1`
**What it does:** Detects and fixes common WSUS + SQL service issues (SQL, WSUS, IIS).  
**Why use it:** Quickly resolve common service-level problems without manual triage.  
**Where to run it:** On the **WSUS server**.

## Suggested folder layout on the WSUS server
```
C:\WSUS\SQLDB\               # SQL + SSMS installers + logs
C:\WSUS\                    # WSUS content (must be this path)
C:\WSUS\Scripts\            # Put these scripts here for consistency
C:\WSUS\Logs\               # Log output
```

## Online WSUS export location
The **online WSUS server (Server LSJ)** exports the database and content to:

```
D:\WSUS-Exports
```

Copy from this location when moving updates to **airgapped WSUS servers**.

## Example usage

### Install WSUS + SQL Express
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\Run-WsusSql.ps1
```

### Validate + fix content configuration
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\Check-WSUSContent.ps1 -FixIssues
```

### Troubleshooter (services + content)
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\Run-WsusTroubleshooter.ps1 -FixContentIssues
```

### Restore a SUSDB backup
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\ImportScript.ps1
```

### Monthly maintenance
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\WsusMaintenance.ps1
```

Skip the heavy cleanup stage if needed:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\WsusMaintenance.ps1 -SkipUltimateCleanup
```

### Force a client check-in
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\Force-WSUSCheckIn.ps1
```

### Reset WSUS content files
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\Reset-WsusContent.ps1
```

### Create or import WSUS GPOs
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\WSUS\Scripts\Set-WsusGpo.ps1 -WsusServerUrl "http://WSUSServerName:8530"
```

## Robocopy examples (moving exports to airgapped WSUS servers)
Examples below mirror `Robocopy_example.txt` and show common transfer paths for the WSUS export data.

```powershell
robocopy "D:\WSUS-Exports" "<Apricorn Path>" /MIR /MT:16 /R:2 /W:5 /LOG:"C:\Logs\Export_%DATE%_%TIME%.log" /TEE
robocopy "\\10.120.129.172\d\WSUS-Exports" "<Apricorn Path>" /MIR /MT:16 /R:2 /W:5 /LOG:"C:\Logs\Export_%DATE%_%TIME%.log" /TEE

robocopy "\\10.120.129.172\d\WSUS-Exports" "\\10.120.129.116\WSUS" /MIR /MT:16 /R:2 /W:5 /LOG:"C:\Logs\Export_%DATE%_%TIME%.log" /TEE

robocopy "\\sandbox-hyperv\v\WSUS" "C:\WSUS" /MIR /MT:16 /R:2 /W:5 /LOG:"C:\Logs\Export_%DATE%_%TIME%.log" /TEE
```

## Notes and known behaviors
- **Content path must be `C:\WSUS`.** `C:\WSUS\wsuscontent` is known to cause endless downloads and an unregistered file state in SUSDB.
- The **install script removes its temporary SA password file** for security.
- `ImportScript.ps1` uses a **fixed backup path** today; update it if your backup name changes.

## Consolidation suggestions
If you want fewer entry points, here are safe merge/rename ideas:
- Keep `Run-WsusSql.ps1`, `install.ps1`, and `Check-WSUSContent.ps1` as the main deployment flow.
- `PS commands.txt` and `Robocopy_example.txt` are reference snippets; move them into scripts if you want everything executable.
