# Roadmap: v4.6 (Lean Scope)

## Goal

Deliver high-value visibility improvements without destabilizing core WSUS operations.

## Scope Guardrails

- Keep v4.6 focused on three themes only: analytics, notifications, reporting.
- Prefer additive UI/services over invasive refactors.
- Keep migration/cutover work out of scope unless directly required for one of the three themes.

## Milestone Themes

### 1) Analytics MVP (Critical)

**Outcome:** Operators can quickly answer: "What changed?" and "What needs action first?"

- Add dashboard trend cards (sync duration, failed operations, pending updates trend).
- Add "Top Risks" panel (stale clients, service down events, cleanup overdue).
- Add date-range selector with safe defaults (7d/30d).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Trend data loads in <500ms from local cache/log index.
- Cards degrade gracefully when data is unavailable.
- Unit tests cover trend calculations and empty-data behavior.

### 2) Notifications MVP (Important)

**Outcome:** Operators are alerted for actionable failures without log-diving.

- Add in-app notification center (errors/warnings only for MVP).
- Add threshold alerts for critical WSUS/SQL/service health conditions.
- Add optional desktop toast notifications behind a setting toggle.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Duplicate alerts are deduplicated within a cooldown window.
- Notification settings persist and can be reset to defaults.
- Tests cover threshold triggers and dedupe logic.

### 3) Reporting MVP (Important)

**Outcome:** Teams can export concise operational summaries for leadership/status briefs.

- Add weekly summary report template (health, sync, cleanup, client compliance snapshot).
- Reuse CSV export primitives for consistent formatting and escaping.
- Add one-click report generation to Documents folder with timestamped naming.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Report generation completes without UI freeze.
- Output is readable in Excel and plain text viewers.
- Tests validate report schema and field escaping.

## Deferred (Not in v4.6 MVP)

- Full custom report designer.
- Multi-channel notifications (email/Teams/Slack).
- Predictive analytics/ML forecasting.

## Release Readiness Gate

- Maintain or improve existing automated pass rate.
- No regression in operation runner stability.
- Manual smoke test on Windows Server 2019 completed for analytics + notifications + reporting flows.
