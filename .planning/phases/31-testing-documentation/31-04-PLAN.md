2. Full test suite passes (100% pass rate, 560+ tests)
3. Code coverage report shows 80%+ line coverage on new code
4. Zero compiler warnings (PSScriptAnalyzer, Roslyn analyzers)
5. No test regressions (all existing tests still pass)
6. Performance benchmarks show 30% startup improvement
7. README, CHANGELOG, and CLAUDE.md updated and accurate
8. GitHub release draft created with assets and release notes

## Changes Required
