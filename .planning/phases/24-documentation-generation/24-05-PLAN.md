# Phase 24-05: Release Process Documentation

**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Requirements:** DOC-05

## Overview

Document the release process including versioning scheme, changelog maintenance, and steps to publish a release. This ensures anyone can release WSUS Manager, not just the original author.

## Current State

**Versioning:**
- Version in `src/WsusManager.App/WsusManager.App.csproj`
- Git tags for releases (e.g., `v4.4.0`)
- No formal changelog (or minimal changelog)

**Release process:**
- Documented in CI/CD workflow (implicit, not explicit)
- Tribal knowledge (not written down)

## Target State

- **Release process doc:** `docs/releases.md` with step-by-step instructions
- **CHANGELOG.md:** Formal changelog following "Keep a Changelog" format
- **Versioning guidelines:** Semantic versioning rules
- **CONTRIBUTING.md updated:** References release process doc

## Success Criteria

1. Release process documentation created (`docs/releases.md`)
2. CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog format
3. Versioning scheme is documented and consistent
4. Release checklist exists (step-by-step guide)
5. New maintainer can release following docs alone
6. All links in docs resolve correctly

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Release Process Documentation

**File:** `docs/releases.md`

**Content:**
```markdown
# Release Process

This document describes the release process for WSUS Manager, including versioning, changelog maintenance, and publishing steps.

## Versioning

WSUS Manager uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Examples:
- 4.0.0 - Initial C# release
- 4.1.0 - New features (backward compatible)
- 4.1.1 - Bug fix (backward compatible)
- 5.0.0 - Breaking changes
```

### Version Number Components

- **MAJOR:** Incompatible API changes or major rewrite
- **MINOR:** New functionality (backward compatible)
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions use suffixes:

```
4.4.0-alpha.1   - First alpha release
4.4.0-beta.1    - First beta release
4.4.0-rc.1      - First release candidate
4.4.0           - Stable release
```

### Version Location

Version is stored in:
- **Source:** `src/WsusManager.App/WsusManager.App.csproj` ( `<Version>` element)
- **Product:** EXE properties (File Version, Product Version)
- **Git tag:** Annotated tag matching version (e.g., `v4.4.0`)

**Important:** Keep version in `.csproj` as single source of truth.

## Changelog

WSUS Manager follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

### Changelog Format

**File:** `CHANGELOG.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to WSUS Manager will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Release Workflow

### Automated Release (Recommended)

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates releases when you push a version tag:

1. **Update version and changelog** (see Pre-Release checklist)
2. **Commit and push** changes to main
3. **Create and push tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v4.4.0
   git push origin v4.4.0
   ```
4. **Workflow runs automatically**
   - Builds solution
   - Runs tests
   - Publishes EXE
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Uploads EXE as asset

### Manual Release (Fallback)

If automated workflow fails, create release manually:

1. **Follow Pre-Release checklist**
2. **Build EXE locally**
   ```bash
   dotnet publish src/WsusManager.App/WsusManager.App.csproj \
     --configuration Release \
     --runtime win-x64 \
     --self-contained true \
     --output publish \
     -p:PublishSingleFile=true
   ```
3. **Create ZIP archive**
   ```bash
   Compress-Archive -Path publish/WsusManager.exe -DestinationPath WsusManager-v4.4.0.zip
   ```
4. **Create GitHub release**
   - Go to https://github.com/anthonyscry/GA-WsusManager/releases/new
   - Choose tag (must exist)
   - Release title: `v4.4.0`
   - Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md
   - Attach `WsusManager-v4.4.0.zip`
   - Publish release

## Hotfix Releases

For critical bugs requiring immediate release:

1. **Create hotfix branch** from release tag
   ```bash
   git checkout v4.4.0
   git checkout -b hotfix/v4.4.1
   ```

2. **Fix bug** and test thoroughly

3. **Update version** to patch version (e.g., 4.4.1)

4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with fix description

5. **Commit and push** hotfix branch

6. **Create PR** to main branch

7. **Merge PR** after review

8. **Create tag** and release as normal

9. **Merge hotfix back** to main branch for next release

## Branching Strategy

WSUS Manager uses simplified Git flow:

```
main (4.4.0) ────────┐
                    │
  ┌─────────────────┘
  │
  ├─ feature/new-feature (PR → main)
  ├─ fix/bug-fix (PR → main)
  └─ hotfix/v4.4.1 (PR → main, tag v4.4.1)

Tags:
- v4.4.0 (release)
- v4.4.1 (hotfix)
```

**Rules:**
- All development happens on `main` branch
- Feature branches for PRs
- Hotfix branches for urgent fixes
- Tags only on `main` branch

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issue found after release:

1. **Yank release** (GitHub → Releases → Edit → Delete release, keep tag)
2. **Fix issue** in hotfix branch
3. **Release patch version** (e.g., 4.4.1 if 4.4.0 was bad)
4. **Announce issue** and recommend upgrade

**Note:** Don't delete git tags - they're part of Git history.

- Incompatible API changes
- Removed features
- Major architecture change

1. Update version in `src/WsusManager.App/WsusManager.App.csproj`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. Commit and push to main branch
4. Create git tag: `git tag v4.4.0 && git push origin v4.4.0`
5. GitHub Actions creates release automatically
6. Approve prerelease and publish

For full details, including pre-release checklist and rollback procedures, refer to `docs/releases.md`.
