## Key Deliverables

### 24-01: User Documentation (README.md)

**Updates to README.md:**
- Reflect C# v4.x application (not PowerShell v3.x)
- Add screenshots (Dashboard, Diagnostics, Settings, Transfer)
- Update build instructions (dotnet build, not build.ps1)
- Update requirements (.NET 8 Desktop Runtime)
- Update project structure (src/ directory)
- Expand troubleshooting section (6+ common issues)
- Update CLI usage (GUI-focused, CLI planned for v4.5)

**Screenshots to capture:**
1. `docs/screenshots/dashboard.png`
2. `docs/screenshots/diagnostics.png`
3. `docs/screenshots/settings.png`
4. `docs/screenshots/transfer.png`

### 24-02: Developer Documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Additions to CONTRIBUTING.md:**
- CI/CD pipeline documentation section
- Testing patterns section (AAA pattern, mocking, what to test/not test)
- PowerShell scripts section (explaining C# integration)
- Enhanced "Adding New Features" workflow with XML docs
- Release process reference
- Getting help section with support channels

### 24-03: API Documentation (DocFX)

**New files:**
- `docfx/docfx.json` - DocFX configuration
- `docfx/filterConfig.yml` - Filter to exclude internal APIs
- `docfx/api/index.md` - API reference index page
- `docs/api/` - Generated HTML documentation

**Tools:**
- DocFX (global install or local tool)
- XML documentation from Phase 20

**Output:** Browsable HTML API reference with search

### 24-04: CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

**New file:**
- `docs/ci-cd.md` - Complete CI/CD pipeline documentation

**Sections:**
- Workflow overview with diagram
- Build C# WSUS Manager workflow
- Release C# WSUS Manager workflow
- Build PowerShell GUI workflow (legacy)
- Pipeline stages (Build, Test, Publish)
- Artifacts (test results, coverage, EXE)
- Troubleshooting guide (5+ common issues)

### 24-05: Release Process Documentation

**New files:**
- `docs/releases.md` - Release process documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history (Keep a Changelog format)

**Sections:**
- Versioning (Semantic Versioning)
- Changelog format and guidelines
- Release checklist (Pre-Release, Release, Post-Release)
- Automated vs Manual release
- Hotfix process
- Branching strategy
- Rollback procedure

### 24-06: Architecture Documentation

**New file:**
- `docs/architecture.md` - Architecture and design decisions

**Sections:**
- Overview and design goals
- Architecture diagram
- Component layers (Presentation, Business Logic, External Integration)
- MVVM pattern explanation
- Dependency injection
- Async/await pattern
- Data binding
- Logging
- Theme system
- Testing strategy
- Design decisions (Why .NET 8? Why WPF? Why MVVM? etc.)

## Dependencies

**External dependencies:**
- **Phase 20 (XML Documentation):** Required for API docs (DOC-03)
- **DocFX:** Must be installed for API documentation generation
- **Screenshots:** Must capture application UI for README.md

**Internal dependencies:**
- None - all plans can execute independently

## Success Criteria

**Phase-level success criteria:**

1. All 6 documentation requirements satisfied (DOC-01 through DOC-06)
2. New users can install and run application from README instructions
3. Contributors can build, test, and submit changes following CONTRIBUTING.md
4. API documentation website browsable with generated HTML
5. CI/CD pipeline documented with workflow explanations
6. Release process documented with versioning and publish steps
7. Architecture decisions documented for maintainability

## Implementation Order

Recommended order (low to high dependencies):

1. **24-06 (Architecture)** - No dependencies, establishes foundation
2. **24-05 (Release Process)** - No dependencies, standalone doc
3. **24-04 (CI/CD)** - No dependencies, references existing workflows
4. **24-01 (README)** - No dependencies, updates existing file
5. **24-02 (CONTRIBUTING)** - References 24-04 and 24-05
6. **24-03 (API Docs)** - Depends on Phase 20 XML docs

## Estimated Effort

| Plan | Estimated Time | Complexity |
|------|----------------|------------|
| 24-01 | 2-3 hours | Medium (requires screenshots) |
| 24-02 | 1-2 hours | Low (mostly adding sections) |
| 24-03 | 2-3 hours | Medium (DocFX setup, troubleshooting) |
| 24-04 | 1-2 hours | Low (documenting existing workflows) |
| 24-05 | 2-3 hours | Medium (CHANGELOG.md research) |
| 24-06 | 2-3 hours | Medium (architecture diagrams, examples) |
| **Total** | **10-16 hours** | **Medium** |

## Notes

- Screenshots should be captured after all UI features are complete
- DocFX can be noisy during generation - filter warnings are normal
- CHANGELOG.md requires researching roadmap milestones for release notes
- Architecture doc should focus on "what and why", not "how"
- Keep all docs user-focused (avoid internal jargon)
- Test all links before committing (no broken paths)

## Milestone Completion

Phase 24 completes the v4.4 Quality & Polish milestone:

**Phases completed:** 7/7 (18-24)
**Plans completed:** 18/18 plans across all phases
**Requirements satisfied:** 29/29 (100%)

**v4.4 accomplishments:**
- Test coverage measurement and HTML reporting
- Static analysis with zero compiler warnings
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- XML documentation comments for all public APIs
- Comprehensive user and developer documentation

**Next milestone:** v4.5 (features TBD)
