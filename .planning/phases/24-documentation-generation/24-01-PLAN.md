# Phase 24-01: User Documentation (README.md)

**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Requirements:** DOC-01

## Overview

Update README.md to reflect the C# v4.x application (not the PowerShell v3.x). Add screenshots, expand troubleshooting section, and provide clear installation and quick start instructions.

## Current State

README.md describes PowerShell v3.8.11 application:
- References `Scripts/` and `Modules/` folders (PowerShell GUI)
- Build instructions use `build.ps1` and PS2EXE
- Screenshots are missing
- Troubleshooting section is minimal

## Target State

README.md describes C# v4.x application:
- Single-file EXE distribution (no Scripts/Modules folders needed)
- Build instructions use `dotnet build` and `dotnet publish`
- Screenshots show key UI views (Dashboard, Diagnostics, Settings, Transfer)
- Expanded troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions

## Success Criteria

1. README.md accurately describes C# v4.x application (not PowerShell v3.x)
2. Installation instructions work for pre-built EXE and building from source
3. Screenshots are embedded and load correctly (relative paths)
4. Troubleshooting section covers at least 5 common issues with solutions
5. Quick start section gets users running in under 5 minutes

- Remove Scripts/Modules references
- Add src/ directory structure

**New structure:**
```markdown
## Project Structure

```
```

### Step 6: Update CLI Usage Section

**File:** `README.md`
**Lines:** 77-94

**Changes:**
- Remove PowerShell CLI examples (C# version doesn't have CLI yet)
- Add note that CLI is planned for future release
- Focus on GUI usage

**Replacement:**
```markdown
## Usage

### GUI Application

Run `WsusManager.exe` as Administrator. The main dashboard shows:

- **Server Status:** WSUS service, SQL connection, update counts
- **Quick Actions:** Start Services, Diagnostics, Online Sync
- **Navigation:** Dashboard, Diagnostics, Database, WSUS Operations, Install, Schedule, Client Tools, Settings

**Common Workflows:**

1. **First-time Setup:** Click "Install WSUS" and follow the wizard
2. **Health Check:** Click "Diagnostics" to scan and auto-fix issues
3. **Database Cleanup:** Navigate to Database → "Deep Cleanup"
4. **Air-Gap Sync:** Navigate to WSUS Operations → "Transfer" → Export/Import
5. **Client Management:** Navigate to Client Tools → select operation

**Note:** CLI interface is planned for v4.5. Use GUI for all operations.
```

### Step 7: Add Screenshots

**File:** `README.md`
**Location:** After Features section, before Quick Start

**Screenshots needed:**
1. `docs/screenshots/dashboard.png` - Main dashboard with all cards
2. `docs/screenshots/diagnostics.png` - Diagnostics panel with results
3. `docs/screenshots/settings.png` - Settings dialog with theme picker
4. `docs/screenshots/transfer.png` - Transfer dialog for air-gap operations

**Instructions:**
- Capture screenshots from running application (1920x1080 resolution)
- Use Windows Snipping Tool or Win+Shift+S
- Save to `docs/screenshots/` directory
- Embed in README with relative paths

**Markdown format:**
```markdown
## Screenshots

### Dashboard
![Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

### Diagnostics
![Diagnostics](docs/screenshots/diagnostics.png)

### Settings
![Settings](docs/screenshots/settings.png)

### Air-Gap Transfer
![Transfer](docs/screenshots/transfer.png)
```

### Step 8: Expand Troubleshooting Section

**File:** `README.md`
**Location:** After Recent Changes section

**Add at least 5 common issues:**

1. **"WSUS service not installed"**
   - Cause: WSUS role not installed on server
   - Solution: Install WSUS role via Server Manager or click "Install WSUS" button

2. **"Cannot connect to SQL Server"**
   - Cause: SQL Server service not running
   - Solution: Run Diagnostics → auto-starts SQL service

3. **"Access denied" errors**
   - Cause: Not running as Administrator
   - Solution: Right-click EXE → "Run as administrator"

4. **"Content is still downloading" after restore**
   - Cause: WSUS re-verifying content files (can take 30+ minutes)
   - Solution: Wait for completion, or run "Reset Content" to force re-verification

5. **WinRM operations fail**
   - Cause: WinRM not enabled on remote host
   - Solution: Enable WinRM: `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` on target machine

6. **Application won't start**
   - Cause: .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 not installed
   - Solution: Download from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0

### Step 9: Update Documentation Links

**File:** `README.md`
**Lines:** 141-146

**Changes:**
- Remove reference to PowerShell Modules/README.md
- Add link to API documentation (to be created in 24-03)
- Keep CLAUDE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md links

**New section:**
```markdown
## Documentation

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Development documentation (legacy PowerShell info)
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Contribution guidelines, build instructions, code style
- **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** - C# architecture and design decisions (to be added)
- **[docs/api/](docs/api/)** - API reference documentation (to be generated via DocFX)
```

### Step 10: Remove PowerShell-Specific Sections

**File:** `README.md`

**Sections to remove:**
- "Recent Changes (v3.8.11)" - replace with v4.x changelog reference
- "Previous Changes (v3.8.10)" - remove
- "C# Performance Benchmarking" section - keep, but update paths to src/

**Sections to update:**
- "Testing" - update to use `dotnet test` instead of `Invoke-Pester`
- "Contributing" - update to reflect C# workflow

## Dependencies

None - this plan can execute independently.

## Verification

**Manual verification steps:**
1. Clone repository and follow README instructions
2. Verify build steps work (dotnet build)
3. Verify all screenshot images load in GitHub markdown preview
4. Verify all troubleshooting issues are accurate
5. Verify no PowerShell-specific references remain

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] README.md describes C# v4.x application accurately
- [ ] 4 screenshots embedded and loading
- [ ] Troubleshooting section has 6+ issues
- [ ] Build instructions work (tested manually)
- [ ] No broken links (all file paths valid)

## Notes

- Preserve existing links to GitHub resources (Issues, Releases)
- Keep tone direct and task-oriented
- Avoid marketing fluff - WSUS admins want facts
- Screenshots should show actual app, not mockups
- Test README in GitHub preview mode before committing
