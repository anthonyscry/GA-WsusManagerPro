---

## 7. Installation Procedure

### 7.1 Pre-Installation Checklist

| Step | Action | Verification |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Download WSUS Manager package | Extract to `C:\WSUS\` |
| 2 | Download SQL Server Express 2022 | Save to `C:\WSUS\SQLDB\` |
| 3 | Download SSMS (optional) | Save to `C:\WSUS\SQLDB\` |
| 4 | Verify disk space | Minimum 200 GB free on C: |
| 5 | Verify admin privileges | Right-click > Run as Administrator |

### 7.2 Installation Steps

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Launch `WsusManager.exe` as Administrator |
| 2 | Click **Install WSUS** from the Operations menu |
| 3 | Select the folder containing SQL installers (default: `C:\WSUS\SQLDB\`) |
| 4 | Wait for installation to complete (10-30 minutes) |
| 5 | Verify dashboard shows all services running (green) |

### 7.3 Install Script Flags (Optional)

The install script `Scripts/Install-WsusWithSqlExpress.ps1` accepts optional flags for HTTPS mode and certificate selection.
- `-EnableHttps` enables the HTTPS listener after installation.
- `-CertificateThumbprint` specifies the certificate used for the HTTPS port.

Guardrail: when `-EnableHttps` is combined with `-NonInteractive`, you must also provide `-CertificateThumbprint`.

Example (default HTTP, non-interactive):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Scripts\Install-WsusWithSqlExpress.ps1 -InstallerPath "C:\WSUS\SQLDB" -SaPassword "<StrongPassword>" -NonInteractive
```

Example (HTTPS, non-interactive):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Scripts\Install-WsusWithSqlExpress.ps1 -InstallerPath "C:\WSUS\SQLDB" -SaPassword "<StrongPassword>" -NonInteractive -EnableHttps -CertificateThumbprint "ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12"
```

---

## 13. Database Management

### 13.1 Database Backup

Database backups are automatically created during:
- Online Sync (Full Sync profile)
- Export to Media operations

Backup location: `C:\WSUS\SUSDB_backup_YYYYMMDD.bak`

### 13.2 Database Restore Procedure

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Click **Restore Database** from Operations menu |
| 2 | Select backup file (.bak) |
| 3 | Confirm restore operation |
| 4 | Wait for restore to complete |
| 5 | Verify dashboard shows database status |

**Important:** After restoring the database, the WSUS server will need to re-verify and re-download update content. **This process can take 30+ minutes depending on your content size.** The dashboard may show "Update is downloading" status during this time - this is normal behavior. Do not interrupt the process. Large content stores (200GB+) may take several hours to fully re-verify.

### 13.3 SQL Sysadmin Permission Setup

Required for database operations (Restore, Deep Cleanup, Maintenance).

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) |
| 2 | Connect to `localhost\SQLEXPRESS` |
| 3 | Expand Security > Logins |
| 4 | Right-click Logins > New Login |
| 5 | Add your domain user or group |
| 6 | Select Server Roles > Check **sysadmin** |
| 7 | Click OK |

---

## 14. Domain Controller Configuration

Run on the Domain Controller, not the WSUS server.

### 14.1 GPO Deployment

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | On WSUS server: Click **Create GPO**, then enter WSUS hostname + HTTP/HTTPS ports |
| 2 | If ports are blank/invalid, defaults are HTTP `8530` and HTTPS `8531` |
| 3 | Copy `C:\WSUS\WSUS GPO` (including `Run-WsusGpoSetup.ps1`) to Domain Controller |
| 4 | On DC: Open PowerShell as Administrator |
| 5 | Run: `Set-Location 'C:\WSUS\WSUS GPO'` |
| 6 | Run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Run-WsusGpoSetup.ps1` |
| 7 | Optional HTTPS mode: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Run-WsusGpoSetup.ps1 -UseHttps` |

Run the wrapper locally on the Domain Controller. It performs DC-local setup and does not prompt for WSUS-server credentials or use remote mode.

### 14.2 GPOs Created

| GPO Name | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| WSUS Update Policy | Client update settings |
| WSUS Inbound Allow | Inbound firewall rules |
| WSUS Outbound Allow | Outbound firewall rules |

### 14.3 Client Verification

On client machines, run:
```powershell
gpupdate /force
wuauclt /detectnow /reportnow
```

## 15. Troubleshooting

### 15.1 Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Endless downloads | Wrong content path | Set content path to `C:\WSUS\` (not `C:\WSUS\wsuscontent\`) |
| "Content downloading" after import | DB/content mismatch | Click **Reset Content** to re-verify files |
| Clients not updating | GPO not applied | Run `gpupdate /force`, check ports 8530/8531 |
| Database errors | Missing sysadmin | Grant sysadmin role in SSMS |
| Services not starting | Dependency issues | Use "Start Services" button on dashboard |
| Script not found | Missing folders | Ensure Scripts/ and Modules/ are with EXE |
| DB size shows "Offline" | SQL not running | Start SQL Server Express service |

### 15.2 Diagnostics Failures

| Check | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Services Stopped | Run **Diagnostics** to auto-recover |
| SQL Browser Not Running | Diagnostics will start and set to Automatic |
| Firewall Rules Missing | Diagnostics creates required rules automatically |
| Permissions Incorrect | Diagnostics sets correct ACLs on content folder |
| Database Connection Failed | Verify SQL Server is running, check sysadmin role |
| NETWORK SERVICE Login Missing | Diagnostics creates SQL login with dbcreator role |
| WSUS Application Pool Stopped | Diagnostics starts the WsusPool |
